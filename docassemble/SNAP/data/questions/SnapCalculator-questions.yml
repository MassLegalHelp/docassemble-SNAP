  Welcome to MLRI's **Massachusetts SNAP online calculator** where you can estimate monthly SNAP benefits for Massachusetts households. Note, during the COVID-19 pandemic:

  * All households eligible for a SNAP benefit currently receive the maximum SNAP amount for their household size. If not getting the maximum, DTA issues a SNAP supplement on the 2nd business day of the following month.
  * From January to June 2021, SNAP benefit amounts are increased by 15%. DTA also issues the 15% boost amount on the 2nd business day of the following month.
  * This SNAP calculator includes the 15% boost in the SNAP math. This calculator does not include the supplemental payments issued to households not already at the maximum grant amount. See [MassLegalServices.org/DTA-COVID-19](https://MassLegalServices.org/DTA-COVID-19) to learn more.

  Please review the SNAP Advocacy Guide to learn who needs to be part of a SNAP household, what income counts, what expenses can be claimed, and how the SNAP math works if the household contains an ineligible member.
